## Transfection Test
- Here medium = DMEM + 10% FBS
- First, routine wash and trypsinise (detach) the cells. Then, transfer the cells onto a 24-well plate (0.5 mL per well; **what is the concentration of the cell?**). Transfect the cells with Lipofectamine + plasmid DNA:
	- Mix 2 $\mu$L Lipofectamine and 50 $\mu$L medium. Incubate at RT for 5 minutes.
	- Mix 50 $\mu$L medium + 0.8 $\mu$g DNA.
	- Mix incubated Lipofectamine and medium with 0.8 $\mu$g DNA. -> 100 $\mu$L in total.
	- Incubate 20 minutes.
- Top up each well with fresh medium to 0.9 mL. Then, once incubation is finished, add the reaction mix to top up to 1 mL per well.
