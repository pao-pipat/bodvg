## Molecular Biology

To produce viral glycoproteins for structural studies, we employ multiple techniques in molecular biology. Here are the protocols used in this project:

### Cloning

- A list of [[Primers]]
- [[BoDV-1 G constructs]] designs for mammalian cell expression
- [[Cloning]] protocols and results
- [[Transfection Test]]

### Protein production and Purification
