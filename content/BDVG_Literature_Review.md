## Summary

## Introduction
- Borna Disease virus (BDV) is a non-segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. 
- The genome structure of Bornaviruses is 3’ *-N-P-M-G-L-* 5’. *N* is the gene coding for the nucleoprotein that binds to its RNA in the mature virion. *P* is coding the phosphoprotein. *M* is coding for the matrix protein. *L* is coding for its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
- BDV infects CNS of horse, sheep, and other domesticated animals, causing neurological disorders.

## A section on Pathology?
- Experiments in rats showed that BDV mainly propagates in the limbic system with undetectable amount of mature virions (Ref needed). -> Cell-to-cell spread may be the main entry mechanism rather than *de novo* infection. Infection is noncytolytic.
## The role of BDVG in cell entry
- *G* gene codes for the viral surface glycoprotein (BDVG) which is important in viral-host membrane fusion and cell entry. BDVG is first produced as a polypeptide of molecular weight 56 kDa (p56). p56 is then heavily N-glycosylated at the endoplasmic reticulum, and becomes gp84. It is then proteolytically cleaved by Furin protease, resulting in gp41 (N-terminal; GP-1) and gp43 (C-terminal; GP-2) [@gonzalez-duniaMechanismBornaDisease1998]. Only gp43 remains at the cell surface after infection [@gonzalez-duniaMechanismBornaDisease1998].
- Syncytium can then be induced by later treatment of the infected cells with low pH medium[@gonzalez-duniaMechanismBornaDisease1998]. 
- The earlier model of BDV infection therefore involves GP1 as the main driver of cell entry while GP2 drives pH-dependent fusion [@makinoBindingPropertiesGP12009].
### Cell-to-Cell spread of BDV
- Initial cell entry and cell-to-cell spread can occur through different pathways. 
- An early study in rats by [@gosztonyiInteractionsViralProteins2001] showed that no virions were visualised in infected brains but the pathology persisted. Hence, cell-to-cell spread independent of its glycoprotein (i.e. through non-enveloped RNP) was hypothesised. 
- *This point may be expanded further using evidence from related viral species such as arenaviruses.*
- **In BDV case, it is speculated that cell-to-cell spread might occur through non-enveloped RNP formed in neurons.** Need reference for this.
- Later experiments, however, showed that Furin cleavage is not required for cell-to-cell spread [@clementeCelltoCellSpreadBorna2007]. This experiment was done on a mutant cell line lacking functional Furin protease. The authors showed that the co-cultured infected cells with healthy cells in a sterile medium did not lead to further spread of BDV infection [@clementeCelltoCellSpreadBorna2007]. 
- This experiment, however, did not test whether the gene for Furin was actually knocked out by sequencing. 
## BDVG structure prediction
- Starts with the structure prediction by [@garryProteomicsComputationalAnalyses2009] using Bioinformatics.
- Then present my own AlphaFold structure analysis.
