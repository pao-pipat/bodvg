## Background information about BoDV

*Bornaviridae* is a family of nonsegmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of ~9 kb. These viruses infect mammals, fish, and reptiles. There are 3 genera in this family: *Carbovirus*, *Cultervirus*, and *Orthobornavirus* ([Rubbenstroth *et al.*, 2021](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.001613)). Examples of the most studied ones are *Orthobornavirus bornaense* or Borna Disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) which infects mammals, including human, causing lethal encephalitis and behaviour changes ([Rubbenstroth *et al.*, 2019](https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007873)), and *Orthobornavirus sciuri* or Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1) which has a reservoir in exotic squirrels and causes lethal encephalitis cases in at least four humans in 2013 ([Hoffmann *et al.*, 2015](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1415627); [Tappe *et al.*, 2018](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/6/17-2027_article)). For both viruses, zoonotic transmission from its reservoirs (bicoloured white-toothed shrews for BoDV-1 and exotic squirrels for VSBV-1) to other hosts such as horses, sheep, and humans, is lethal and likely dead-end ([Rubbenstroth *et al.*, 2019](https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007873); [Ebinger *et al.*, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52192-x)). There are currently no commercially available antivirals and vaccines against these viruses for both animals and humans despite some recent developments (Ribavirin: [Jordan *et al.*, 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC104326/); [Byeong-Jee *et al.*, 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18778737/); [Reuter *et al.*, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27439314/#:~:text=Combined%20treatment%20of%20avian%20bornavirus,compared%20to%20either%20drug%20alone.), Favipiravir: [Tokunaga *et al.*, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28465146/), Review on immunisation methods: [Rubbenstroth, 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/7/1513)). Furthermore, our understanding of the biology of the virus is limited. Hence, there is a great interest in developing our knowledge of bornaviruses and finding prophylactic interventions to curb the zoonotic spread into domesticated animals and humans.

## Organisation of the genome

Orthobornaviruses contain the following gene order in its genome: 3'-N-X-P-M-G-L-5', while carbo- and culterviruses have the order of G and M reversed (3'-N-X-P-G-M-L-5'), ([Nobach *et al.*, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352720300221?via%3Dihub)). *N*, *X*, *P*, *M*, *G*, and *L* genes encode Nucleoprotein (N), Accessory protein (X), Phosphoprotein (P), Matrix protein (M), Glycoprotein (G), and Large (L) protein containing an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain. The viral genome itself is not 5'-capped and not polyadenylated ([Rubbenstroth *et al.*, 2021](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/jgv.0.001613)). N, M, and G proteins are structural proteins that form the complete virion. N binds to the viral genome to form the viral Ribonucloprotein (vRNP) and M forma the matrix coating on the intra-envelope side of the viral membrane. G is a transmembrane protein that potentially determines the tropism and infectivity of the virus. X, P, and L proteins are important for viral replication and assembly inside the host cell.
## Viral Life cycle



## Why Glycoprotein?

The virion is an enveloped particle decorated with the virus glycoprotein (G) encoded for by *G* gene. Because of its localisation on the virus surface, G is thought to play a role in host receptor recognition, fusion between the host and viral membranes, and the virus tropism.
